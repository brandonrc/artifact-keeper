## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Artifact Health Scoring & Quality Gates** (#129)
  - Pluggable quality check system with composite health scores (A-F grade) and configurable quality gates for promotion gating
  - MetadataCompletenessChecker (all formats) and HelmLintChecker (in-process chart.tgz validation)
  - QualityCheckService orchestrator with weighted scoring (security=40, quality=25, license=20, metadata=15)
  - 15 new API endpoints under `/api/v1/quality`; async checks triggered on artifact upload
- **Sync Policy Engine & Background Sync Worker** (#109, #122)
  - Declarative label-based replication policies with JSONB selectors for repos and peers
  - 8 new API endpoints (`/api/v1/sync-policies`) for CRUD, evaluation, and preview
  - Peer instance labels API (`GET/PUT/POST/DELETE /api/v1/peers/:id/labels`) for `match_labels` resolution (#122)
  - Auto-evaluate triggers on repo label, peer label, and new peer registration changes (#122)
  - 5-minute periodic re-evaluation scheduler to catch drift (#122)
  - Background sync worker with per-peer sync windows, exponential backoff, and concurrent transfer limits
- **Remote Proxy Repositories** (#112)
  - Remote repos now proxy artifacts from upstream registries (npmjs.org, PyPI, Maven Central, etc.) on cache miss
  - Automatic local caching with 24-hour TTL and ETag-based revalidation
  - ProxyService wired into all 28 format handlers for download endpoints
  - Write guards return 405 Method Not Allowed on remote repos
- **Virtual Repository Resolution** (#112)
  - Virtual repos aggregate multiple member repos (local + remote) with priority-based resolution
  - Metadata merging for npm (`get_package_metadata`) and PyPI (`simple_project`) so native clients (`npm install`, `pip install`) work through virtual repos
  - Write guards return 400 Bad Request on virtual repos
  - Tarball URL rewriting to route downloads through the virtual repo key
- **Protobuf/BSR Format Support** (#119)
  - New `protobuf` repository format implementing BSR-compatible Connect RPC endpoints
  - 10 endpoints: GetModules, CreateModules, GetCommits, ListCommits, Upload, Download, GetLabels, CreateOrUpdateLabels, GetGraph, GetResources
  - Full proxy/virtual repository resolution support
- **Repository Key Renames** (#120) — `PATCH /api/v1/repositories/{key}` now accepts a `key` field to rename the URL slug
- **Repository Labels API** (#108)
- **Artifact Upload Sync Trigger** (#108)
- **Full-stack Kubernetes Manifest** (#104)
- **Proxy/Virtual E2E Test Suite** (#112)
  - 21-test script covering proxy downloads, write rejection, virtual resolution, and native client integration
  - Docker Compose `proxy` profile for CI
  - Bootstrap script creates remote, local, and virtual repos with member wiring
- **Mesh Replication E2E Workflow** (#127) — GitHub Actions workflow for automated mesh replication testing via ArgoCD
- **Stale Bot** (#121) — auto-labels inactive issues

### Fixed
- **Proxy cache key collision**: Metadata cached as file blocked tarball paths that needed same prefix as directory; fixed with `__content__` leaf file scheme (#112)
- Fix `replication_mode` enum type cast in sync policy evaluate (#126)
- Fix `format` column type mismatch in sync policy evaluate (#125)
- Fix peer instance labels auth middleware mismatch (#124)
- Use AWS default credential chain instead of env vars only (#106)
- Ensure admin login works on fresh installs and fix Dependency-Track startup race (#102)
- Add setup instructions to `admin.password` file so users know to login first (#100)
- Auto-enable NVD API 2.0 and add proxy passthrough for Dependency-Track (#98)
- Set global 512 MB body limit to prevent silent upload truncation (#97)

### Changed
- Moved `site/` to separate `artifact-keeper-site` repository (#101)

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-02-08

Bug fix release resolving 9 issues found by automated stress testing, plus build hygiene improvements.

### Fixed
- **Promotion handler**: Fix storage_key bind using `artifact.path` instead of `artifact.storage_key`, causing promoted artifacts to be undownloadable (#65, #72)
- **Promotion handler**: Replace direct `tokio::fs::copy` with `FilesystemStorage` abstraction to respect content-addressable sharding (#65, #72)
- **Repository key validation**: Add strict allowlist rejecting path traversal, XSS, SQL injection chars, null bytes, and keys over 128 characters (#69, #70)
- **Upload size limit**: Add `DefaultBodyLimit::max(512MB)` to repository router; Axum default 2MB was blocking legitimate uploads (#67)
- **Rate limiting**: Increase API rate limit from 100 to 1000 req/min, auth from 10 to 30 req/min (#66, #68, #71, #73)
- **Download panic**: Lowercase `X_ARTIFACT_STORAGE` header constant for `HeaderName::from_static()` compatibility
- Correct `AuthExtension` type in promotion handlers (#62)
- Remove extra blank lines in promotion handlers (#63)
- Fix pre-release banner overlapping content on mobile (#64)
- Use dev tag for main builds, latest only on release tags (#60)
