## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-02-08

Bug fix release resolving 9 issues found by automated stress testing, plus build hygiene improvements.

### Fixed
- **Promotion handler**: Fix storage_key bind using `artifact.path` instead of `artifact.storage_key`, causing promoted artifacts to be undownloadable (#65, #72)
- **Promotion handler**: Replace direct `tokio::fs::copy` with `FilesystemStorage` abstraction to respect content-addressable sharding (#65, #72)
- **Repository key validation**: Add strict allowlist rejecting path traversal, XSS, SQL injection chars, null bytes, and keys over 128 characters (#69, #70)
- **Upload size limit**: Add `DefaultBodyLimit::max(512MB)` to repository router; Axum default 2MB was blocking legitimate uploads (#67)
- **Rate limiting**: Increase API rate limit from 100 to 1000 req/min, auth from 10 to 30 req/min (#66, #68, #71, #73)
- **Download panic**: Lowercase `X_ARTIFACT_STORAGE` header constant for `HeaderName::from_static()` compatibility
- Correct `AuthExtension` type in promotion handlers (#62)
- Remove extra blank lines in promotion handlers (#63)
