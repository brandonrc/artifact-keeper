    # rsa 0.9.10 - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
    # No fix available upstream. This is a transitive dependency from sqlx-mysql
    # which we don't use (we use postgres). The vulnerability requires:
    # 1. An attacker to have network access to the server
    # 2. Ability to measure timing differences with high precision
    # 3. The server to be using RSA for authentication
    # Risk is low for our use case as we don't use MySQL or RSA authentication.
