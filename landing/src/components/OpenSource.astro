      Artifact Keeper is MIT licensed. Not "open-core" with all the good stuff behind a paywall.
      Not "source available" with a license that restricts how you use it. Actually, genuinely open source.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
      Every feature&mdash;security scanning, all package formats, RBAC, SSO, migration tools&mdash;is
      included in the open-source release. No bait-and-switch. No enterprise edition.
      Fork it, modify it, run it however you want.
