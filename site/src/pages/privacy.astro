      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Artifact Keeper ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares
        information when you use our applications and services, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Artifact Keeper Server (self-hosted)</li>
        <li>Artifact Keeper for iOS</li>
        <li>Artifact Keeper for macOS</li>
        <li>Artifact Keeper for Android</li>
        <li>Artifact Keeper Web Interface</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Self-Hosted Server</h3>
      <p>
        Artifact Keeper Server is designed to be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. When you run
        Artifact Keeper Server:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not collect any data.</strong> All data remains on your servers under your control.</li>
        <li>No telemetry, analytics, or usage data is sent to us.</li>
        <li>No network requests are made to our servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mobile and Desktop Applications</h3>
      <p>
        Our iOS, macOS, and Android applications connect to Artifact Keeper servers that you configure.
        These apps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Store server credentials locally</strong> on your device using secure storage (Keychain on Apple platforms, EncryptedSharedPreferences on Android).</li>
        <li><strong>Do not collect personal information</strong> or send data to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not include third-party analytics</strong> or advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate only</strong> with the Artifact Keeper servers you configure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Demo Instance</h3>
      <p>
        If you use our public demo instance at demo.artifactkeeper.com:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic server logs (IP addresses, timestamps) may be collected for security and abuse prevention.</li>
        <li>Any artifacts you upload to the demo are visible to other demo users and may be periodically deleted.</li>
        <li>Do not upload sensitive or private data to the demo instance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>
        For self-hosted installations and our mobile/desktop apps, we do not collect or use any of your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the demo instance, server logs may be used to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor for abuse and security threats</li>
        <li>Debug technical issues</li>
        <li>Understand general usage patterns (not individual behavior)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Self-hosted:</strong> You are responsible for securing your own Artifact Keeper installation.
        We recommend following the security best practices in our documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mobile apps:</strong> Credentials are stored using platform-native secure storage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iOS/macOS: Keychain Services</li>
        <li>Android: EncryptedSharedPreferences with Android Keystore</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Our applications do not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you configure SSO authentication (LDAP, OIDC, SAML), your Artifact Keeper server will communicate
        with your identity provider according to your configuration.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Artifact Keeper is a developer tool intended for use by software development professionals.
        Our services are not directed at children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect personal data from self-hosted installations or mobile apps, there is
        no personal data for us to provide, correct, or delete.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the demo instance, you may contact us to request deletion of any data associated with your use.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
        posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
      </p>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>
