## Migration Overview

Artifact Keeper includes a built-in migration API that handles:

- Repository structure and configuration
- All artifacts with metadata
- Version history and checksums
- User permissions and access control
- Repository-level settings

The migration process is designed for zero-downtime transitions using a parallel-run approach.

## Prerequisites

Before starting migration:

1. **Artifactory Access**:
   - Admin credentials or API token
   - Network access to Artifactory server
   - Read access to all repositories you want to migrate

2. **Artifact Keeper Setup**:
   - Running Artifact Keeper instance (see [Installation](/getting-started/installation))
   - Sufficient storage for migrated artifacts
   - Database with adequate capacity

3. **Network Requirements**:
   - Artifact Keeper can reach Artifactory server
   - Sufficient bandwidth (plan for artifact transfer size)

## Migration Methods

### Method 1: Built-in Migration API (Recommended)

Use Artifact Keeper's migration API for automated, reliable migrations.

#### Step 1: Configure Source

Create a migration configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST https://artifacts.example.com/api/v1/migrations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": {
      "type": "artifactory",
      "url": "https://artifactory.corp.example.com",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin-password-or-token"
    },
    "repositories": [
      "libs-release-local",
      "libs-snapshot-local",
      "docker-local"
    ],
    "options": {
      "include_metadata": true,
      "include_permissions": true,
      "validate_checksums": true,
      "parallel_transfers": 4
    }
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "migration_id": "mig_abc123",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2026-02-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Step 2: Start Migration

```bash
curl -X POST https://artifacts.example.com/api/v1/migrations/mig_abc123/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### Step 3: Monitor Progress

```bash
curl https://artifacts.example.com/api/v1/migrations/mig_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "migration_id": "mig_abc123",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "progress": {
    "total_artifacts": 50000,
    "migrated_artifacts": 12500,
    "failed_artifacts": 0,
    "current_repository": "libs-release-local",
    "percentage_complete": 25.0
  },
  "started_at": "2026-02-01T12:05:00Z",
  "estimated_completion": "2026-02-01T16:30:00Z"
}
```

#### Step 4: Verify Migration

After migration completes, verify the results:

```bash
curl https://artifacts.example.com/api/v1/migrations/mig_abc123/report \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response includes:
- Total artifacts migrated
- Checksum verification results
- Failed artifacts (if any)
- Metadata migration status
- Permission migration status

### Method 2: Manual Migration

For smaller repositories or specific use cases, migrate manually using native clients.

#### Maven Example

```bash
# Download from Artifactory
mvn dependency:get \
  -DremoteRepositories=https://artifactory.corp.example.com/libs-release \
  -DgroupId=com.example \
  -DartifactId=myapp \
  -Dversion=1.0.0

# Deploy to Artifact Keeper
mvn deploy:deploy-file \
  -Durl=https://artifacts.example.com/maven/libs-release \
  -DrepositoryId=artifact-keeper \
  -Dfile=target/myapp-1.0.0.jar \
  -DpomFile=pom.xml
```

#### Docker Example

```bash
# Pull from Artifactory
docker pull artifactory.corp.example.com/docker-local/myimage:latest

# Tag for Artifact Keeper
docker tag artifactory.corp.example.com/docker-local/myimage:latest \
  artifacts.example.com/docker/docker-local/myimage:latest

# Push to Artifact Keeper
docker push artifacts.example.com/docker/docker-local/myimage:latest
```

## Zero-Downtime Migration Strategy

Recommended approach for production environments with no service interruption.

### Phase 1: Parallel Run (Weeks 1-2)

1. **Set up Artifact Keeper** alongside existing Artifactory
2. **Configure read-only access** to Artifactory (no new writes)
3. **Start migration** using the Migration API
4. **Verify data integrity** by comparing checksums

### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Configure clients** to read from Artifact Keeper, fall back to Artifactory
2. **Direct new uploads** to Artifact Keeper
3. **Continue background migration** of remaining artifacts
4. **Monitor both systems** for any discrepancies

Example hybrid configuration (Maven `settings.xml`):
```xml
<mirrors>
  <mirror>
    <id>artifact-keeper</id>
    <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
    <url>https://artifacts.example.com/maven/libs-release</url>
  </mirror>
</mirrors>

<servers>
  <server>
    <id>artifact-keeper</id>
    <username>${env.ARTIFACT_TOKEN}</username>
    <password></password>
  </server>
</servers>
```

### Phase 3: Cutover (Week 3-4)

1. **Complete migration** of all artifacts
2. **Update DNS** or reverse proxy to point to Artifact Keeper
3. **Update CI/CD pipelines** with new repository URLs
4. **Set Artifactory to read-only** as backup
5. **Monitor for 1-2 weeks** before decommissioning Artifactory

### Phase 4: Decommission (Week 4+)

1. **Verify all clients** are using Artifact Keeper
2. **Archive Artifactory data** for compliance/backup
3. **Shut down Artifactory** servers
4. **Celebrate cost savings**

## Large-Scale Migrations

For large repositories with many artifacts:

### Performance Tuning

Increase parallel transfers in migration config:

```json
{
  "options": {
    "parallel_transfers": 8,
    "batch_size": 100,
    "retry_attempts": 3,
    "timeout_seconds": 300
  }
}
```

### Incremental Migration

Migrate in stages by repository priority:

1. **Critical repositories** (production dependencies)
2. **Active repositories** (current development)
3. **Archive repositories** (older versions)
4. **Deprecated repositories** (consider not migrating)

### Resume Failed Migrations

If migration is interrupted, resume from where it left off:

```bash
curl -X POST https://artifacts.example.com/api/v1/migrations/mig_abc123/resume \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The migration API tracks progress and skips already-migrated artifacts.

## Permission Migration

Artifactory permissions can be mapped to Artifact Keeper RBAC:

| Artifactory Permission | Artifact Keeper Role |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Admin | Admin (full access) |
| Deploy/Cache | Write (upload artifacts) |
| Read | Read (download artifacts) |
| Annotate | Write (modify metadata) |
| Delete | Write (delete artifacts) |

The Migration API automatically creates corresponding roles and assignments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Checksum Mismatch**:
```
Error: Checksum verification failed for artifact xyz
```
Solution: Re-download and verify Artifactory source, or skip checksum validation:
```json
{"options": {"validate_checksums": false}}
```

**Authentication Failure**:
```
Error: Failed to authenticate with Artifactory: 401 Unauthorized
```
Solution: Verify credentials, ensure API token has read access to all repositories.

**Storage Full**:
```
Error: Insufficient storage space
```
Solution: Increase storage capacity or migrate in smaller batches.

**Timeout**:
```
Error: Transfer timeout after 300 seconds
```
Solution: Increase timeout or reduce batch size:
```json
{"options": {"timeout_seconds": 600, "batch_size": 50}}
```

- [ ] Test downloading artifacts from all migrated repositories
- [ ] Validate permissions and access control
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline configurations
- [ ] Update developer documentation with new URLs
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Archive or decommission Artifactory

## Cost Savings Calculator

Estimate your savings from migrating:

**Artifactory Pro**: $6,000 - $12,000/year
**Artifactory Enterprise**: $24,000 - $48,000/year
**Artifact Keeper**: $0 (MIT licensed)

**Deployment costs** (one-time):
- Self-hosted: Server costs only (~$100-500/month for infrastructure)
- Managed cloud: Variable based on usage

**Break-even**: Typically 1-2 months after migration
