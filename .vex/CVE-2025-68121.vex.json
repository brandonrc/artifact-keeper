The affected code is in the bundled Grype scanner binary, which only makes outgoing HTTPS connections to fetch vulnerability databases. Grype v0.109.0 is the latest upstream release and has not yet been recompiled with Go 1.25.7+. The scanner runs in an isolated container environment with no inbound TLS listeners. Will be resolved when Grype releases a version compiled with Go >= 1.25.7."
