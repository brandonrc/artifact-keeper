# Release gate: prove that a commit's images passed the full Release Gate
# BEFORE anything gives them a permanent name (issues #3771, #3772).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Until now the immutable git tag was the trigger for testing. Everything
#   downstream of the tag push is irreversible -- the tag (ruleset 19144026),
#   `:X.Y.Z`, and for a while `:latest` -- so a gate failure burned a version
#   number. 1.9.0 hit every edge of that at once (#3769). The candidate flow
#   turns it around: release-candidate.yml gates a COMMIT, using the
#   `sha-<sha>` images Docker Publish already built for it, and on green
#   records a certification. This script is how every later step -- the
#   promote, docker-publish.yml's certified-candidate promote, and the run of
#   release.yml the promote dispatches on the tag -- checks that the
#   certification exists for the commit in front of it and still describes
#   what the registry serves. (A stable tag PUSH is refused outright by both
#   workflows before this script runs: the promote creates every stable tag,
#   and a ref created by GITHUB_TOKEN fires no push event.)
#
# THE CARRIER
#   The certification is a signed attestation (actions/attest, Sigstore via
#   GitHub OIDC) whose SUBJECT is each image's manifest-list digest and whose
#   predicate names the commit, the version, the gate run and every digest.
#   It is verified with `gh attestation verify`, pinned to the EXACT signing
#   identity that is allowed to certify: `--cert-identity
#   https://github.com/<repo>/.github/workflows/release-candidate.yml@refs/heads/main`,
#   the certificate's SubjectAlternativeName, compared byte-for-byte (a
#   `!=` in sigstore-go). Neither of gh's looser pins is enough on its own:
#   `--signer-workflow` builds a SAN regex with no `@ref`, so a copy of
#   release-candidate.yml on a topic branch, gate edited out, would match;
#   `--source-ref` compares the ref extension case-insensitively
#   (strings.EqualFold), so a branch named `Main` would too, and git refs are
#   case-sensitive. `--source-ref refs/heads/main` is still passed as a
#   second, independent check on the ref extension. release-candidate.yml
#   also refuses to run off main, by a case-sensitive shell comparison.
#
#   THIS PIN DOES NOT WIDEN for maintenance releases. A patch release is cut
#   from `release/X.Y.x`, but the candidate is still DISPATCHED ON MAIN and
#   certifies the branch's commit from there, so the only identity that can
#   ever produce an accepted certification remains main's copy of
#   release-candidate.yml. Which commits main may certify is a separate,
#   independent control: scripts/ci/resolve-certified-ref.sh derives the line
#   a commit belongs to from repository state (main, else the
#   `release/<X>.<Y>.x` its own Cargo.toml names) and refuses a commit whose
#   `release-candidate.yml` is not byte-identical to a copy that lives on
#   main. The predicate's `certified_ref` is checked against that derivation
#   below: it says which line the certified commit came from, and a
#   certification whose line disagrees with the repository is not promoted.
#   Nothing that can write an artifact or a commit status can forge it:
#   producing one needs the OIDC identity of release-candidate.yml, on
#   main, in this repository. A workflow artifact and a commit status are
#   written alongside it for humans; they are not what this script trusts.
#
# THE RULE, in one sentence:
#   for every image the release ships, the `sha-<sha>` tag must resolve NOW to
#   a digest that carries a valid certification from release-candidate.yml
#   whose predicate names THIS commit and these SAME digests.
#
#   Each clause is load-bearing:
#     * "resolve now" -- the registry is read at verification time, so an
#       image re-pushed under the same sha tag since certification is refused
#       (its digest has no attestation), and a sha tag that no longer exists
#       is a refusal, never a pass.
#     * "names this commit" -- an attestation is keyed by digest, and the same
#       bytes could in principle be tagged for another commit; the predicate
#       binds the digest set to one commit and the check reads it back.
#     * "these same digests" -- all three images must be named by ONE
#       certification (same candidate run), so a backend certified in one
#       run cannot be paired with an adapter from another. A digest can
#       carry more than one certification (the same commit certified twice
#       is allowed), so the run is chosen by content, deterministically:
#       the highest candidate run id that certified EVERY image for this
#       commit -- never "the first one gh happened to return".
#
# Exit codes (mirrors assert-preflight-evidence.sh):
#   0  certified; the digests and run ids are printed as key=value lines and
#      appended to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set
#   1  BLOCKED -- no certification for this commit, or it no longer matches
#   2  INFRA   -- could not measure (registry / attestations API). NOT a pass.
