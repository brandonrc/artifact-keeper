# Self-test for scripts/ci/resolve-certified-ref.sh and for the dispatch-ref
# guard in .github/workflows/release-candidate.yml (maintenance-line
# candidates).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The resolver decides WHICH COMMITS main's Release Candidate may certify.
#   Get it wrong in the permissive direction and a commit on no release line
#   becomes releasable; get it wrong in the strict direction and a security
#   patch cannot be cut. Neither can be exercised by opening a PR, so
#   the whole world it reads -- the version at the commit, the two ancestry
#   comparisons, the case-sensitive refs lookup and the three workflow blob
#   ids -- is stubbed behind a `gh` on PATH, and this runs offline in ~1s.
#
#   Most cases assert a REFUSAL, because that is the failure direction that
#   matters: an arbitrary branch, a case variant of a real release branch, a
#   commit on neither branch, and -- the backstop for the window in which an
#   admin has the release ruleset toggled off -- a commit whose
#   release-candidate.yml is not the copy main carries. The guard section at
#   the end pins the decision that keeps the signing identity unwidened.
