Users who enable this get better support and help improve the system.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. Server-side crash detection\n- Catch Rust panics via panic hook (std::panic::set_hook)\n- Capture unrecoverable errors (OOM, DB connection failures, migration failures)\n- Structured crash reports: stack trace, error type, OS info, AK version, uptime, last N log lines\n- Scrub PII before submission (remove usernames, IPs, artifact names, repo names)\n\n### 2. Docker Compose error propagation\n- Sidecar container or health-check watcher that monitors all service health endpoints\n- Detect: container OOM kills, restart loops, failed healthchecks, exit codes != 0\n- Aggregate errors from postgres, meilisearch, trivy, backend into a single error report\n- Use docker events API or healthcheck polling\n\n### 3. Submission pipeline\n- POST crash reports to a central Artifact Keeper telemetry endpoint (hosted by us)\n- Fallback: queue reports locally if telemetry endpoint unreachable, retry later\n- Rate limiting to prevent flood during cascading failures\n- Each report gets a unique crash ID for reference\n\n### 4. Auto-issue creation\n- Telemetry backend receives crash reports\n- Deduplicates by error signature (same panic location = same issue)\n- Auto-creates GitHub/GitLab issue (PRIVATE by default)\n- Issue includes: crash summary, frequency count, affected versions, anonymized environment info\n- Links related crashes together\n\n### 5. Privacy \u0026 consent\n- **Strictly opt-in** - disabled by default, explicit admin toggle in system settings\n- Clear documentation of exactly what data is collected\n- PII scrubbing pipeline before submission (configurable scrub rules)\n- Option to review reports before sending (queue + approve workflow)\n- Private issues only - never expose user data in public trackers\n- Data retention policy on telemetry backend (auto-delete after X days)\n- Users can request deletion of their submitted data\n\n## System settings additions\n- telemetry_enabled: bool (default false)\n- telemetry_endpoint: string\n- telemetry_scrub_level: minimal|standard|aggressive\n- telemetry_review_before_send: bool (default true)\n- telemetry_include_logs: bool (default false)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-02T14:31:48.765511-06:00","updated_at":"2026-02-02T18:53:05.829429-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T18:53:05.829429-06:00","close_reason":"Implemented crash_reporting_service.rs with opt-in telemetry, PII scrubbing (3 levels), SHA256 error dedup, queue+approve workflow.

{"id":"artifact-keeper-wjk","title":"EPIC: Artifactory Pain Points - Competitive Advantages","description":"# Artifactory Pain Points Epic\n\nResearch-driven epic to systematically address the top complaints users have with JFrog Artifactory, turning each into a competitive advantage for Artifact Keeper.\n\n## Background\nJFrog Artifactory dominates the artifact registry market but has well-documented pain points across review platforms (PeerSpot, G2, TrustRadius, Capterra) and DevOps communities. Artifact Keeper can differentiate by solving these frustrations.\n\n## Already Addressed\n- **Search engine** - Artifact Keeper already has superior search (noted as a top Artifactory complaint: \"Search functionality lacks adequate jar file searching capabilities\", \"Search results could be more effective\")\n\n## Key Pain Point Categories to Address\n\n### 1. UI/UX Overhaul (Artifactory's #1 complaint)\n- \"GUI is not great - one can get lost in tons of options and struggle to find the right menus\"\n- \"UI responsiveness still needs much improvement\"\n- \"Increases the learning curve which is frustrating\"\n- \"They changed the UI, SSO settings, API interaction, and token generation - very confusing\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Clean, modern UI with sensible defaults, fast navigation, zero learning curve for common tasks\n\n### 2. Performance at Scale\n- \"Performance is an issue when a large number of artifacts exist\"\n- \"Artifactory starts leaking memory and they need to restart it\"\n- \"Slow responses and in the worst case, completely unresponsive\"\n- \"Advanced features require large amount of resources\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Rust backend already gives us a performance edge. Ensure artifact listing, browsing, and API responses stay fast at 100k+ artifacts\n\n### 3. Transparent \u0026 Simple Pricing Model\n- \"Consumption-based pricing makes budgeting difficult - bill grows as team becomes more productive\"\n- \"Had to upgrade to Enterprise X for one feature, paying almost twice the cost\"\n- \"Expensive for individual developers or small organizations\"\n- \"Significant price gap between OSS and enterprise tiers\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Simple, predictable pricing. Open-source core with clear feature tiers. No surprise bills.\n\n### 4. Setup Simplicity \u0026 Self-Hosting\n- \"Complex setup, steep learning curve\"\n- \"Requires a dedicated server, adding overhead\"\n- \"Recovery process is time-taking even for experts\"\n- \"Setting up protected repositories is quite challenging\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Single docker-compose up, sane defaults, guided setup wizard, easy backup/restore\n\n### 5. Documentation Quality\n- \"Documentation is messy - many possibilities for where and how to install\"\n- \"Documentation is a bit sparse\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Clear, opinionated docs with one golden path. API-first with auto-generated docs.\n\n### 6. Reporting \u0026 Lifecycle Management\n- \"Looking for additional reporting on data growth and data aging\"\n- \"Storage lifecycle management reports for admins or users\"\n- \"Missing built-in backup and restore capabilities\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Built-in storage analytics, artifact aging reports, retention policies, one-click backup/restore\n\n### 7. Reliability \u0026 Uptime\n- Over 1,402 tracked outages affecting Artifactory users over 8 years (StatusGator)\n- \"Basic features require enterprise license for backup/recovery\"\n- **Our opportunity**: Lightweight architecture, fast recovery, built-in health checks\n\n### 8. OSS Feature Gating\n- \"OSS version offers only basic features\"\n- \"Basic features require enterprise license\"\n- Free tier is very limited compared to competitors\n- **Our opportunity**: Generous open-source core. Don't gate table-stakes features behind enterprise.\n\n## Sources\n- PeerSpot reviews and improvement requests\n- G2 user reviews (2024-2026)\n- TrustRadius pros and cons\n- Capterra verified reviews\n- Codefresh competitive analysis\n- CloudRepo alternatives guide\n- StatusGator reliability data","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-02T14:15:59.678375-06:00","updated_at":"2026-02-02T18:28:48.097343-06:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T18:28:48.097343-06:00","close_reason":"Research complete, child issues created for implementation","created_by":"Brandon Geraci"}
